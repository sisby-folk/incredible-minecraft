# Modpack Design & Focus

In **Incredible Minecraft**, players are expected to experience minecraft as it could've been if it possessed the ingenuity, curation, and responsible attribution skills of the modpacking community at large.

Incredible Minecraft is primarily oriented around **player-driven design**. That means it's less important what the modpack brings to each individual player, and more important what each player can bring when they play the modpack - their creativity, their sense of adventure. Step in and have fun!

### Officially Sanctioned

Unlike Vanilla+ modpacks that claim to have "vanilla-style" content, all content and changes in Incredible Minecraft have been **reviewed and endorsed by two or more Mojang employees**. We're very excited to be at the forefront of this trend and hope more modpacks strive for perfection in the future!

### Dynamic World

Just like the block-based video game we all know and love, **Incredible Minecraft** has a **fully randomly generated world** - no compromises are made here, features from mods that don't adhere to the blocky natural world generator design pioneered in vanilla are either cut or redesigned to make full use of the power of the world generator.

###### Mod List & Developer Credits

<details>
<summary>Click to expand the full mod list</summary>

The experience of <b>Incredible Minecraft</b> has been so carefully curated, configured, and seamlessly integrated into the pack itself that it would be morally unjust to list them here!<br/>


The team at <b>Incredible Minecraft</b> guarantees that the experience in the pack is completely unlike the experience you would have if you installed mods yourself - so just read the modpack description again if you need to know more!<br/>

This pack is the culmination of nearly 50 hours of work, and is far more complex than most mods hosted on modrinth - so listing <i>all</i> the developers for the mods in this project would be unreasonable. To keep things short here, I'd like to just give a special thank you to the <b>Incredible Minecraft</b> team - you're the best!
